	<h2>Conspiracies in the United States</h2>
	<p>In a case study performed by Chapman University in California on graduate students, it was revealed that the majority of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory. Political unrest is far from unusual, especially in California, an extremely liberal state.<br>
		Here's a breakdown of things the students believed the government was lying about or concealing their knowledge on.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The 9/11 attacks: 54.3 percent agree or strongly agree</li>
		<li>The JFK assassination: 49.6 percent</li>
		<li>Alien encounters: 42.6 percent</li>
		<li>Plans for a one-world government: 32.9 percent</li>
		<li>The origin of the AIDS virus: 30.1 percent</li>
		<li>The moon landing: 24.2 percent</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The most likely demographic to believe in conspiracy theories was Caucasian, Christian, low-income males. They also tended to be more pessimistic and fearful, and less trusting of anyone and anything around them.</p>
