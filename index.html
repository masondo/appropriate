As technology continues to increase in complexity, its tendency to distract and detract from people's actual, real lives increases- not linearly, but exponentially. This means: less healthy meals prepared, less exercise, less care for ourselves. If we continue to mistreat our bodies so substantially, it's inevitable that it will come back to bite us in the rear.</p>
