<h1>Liberalist v. Structuralist Economic Models</h1>
<i><h2>by Mason Doyle</h2></i>
<p>Modernization Model: Walt Rostow’s model assumes all countries follow a five-step path to modernization and higher development. These stages are the traditional stage (wherein most activity is subsistence farming, preconditions to take-off stage (wherein the community becomes more open to new things), take-off stage (industrial revolution), drive to maturity stage (wherein specialization emerges and technology is diffused), and the mass consumption stage (wherein higher incomes are common and the production of goods and services is more widespread).<br>
Dependency Theory: States that resources tend to flow from Less Developed Countries (LDCs) or the “periphery” to More Developed Countries (MDCs) or the “core”, which enriches the latter at the expense of the former. Ideological precursor to the World Systems Theory.<br>
World Systems Theory: Immanuel Wallerstein’s theory divides countries into three groups- core, semi-periphery, and periphery- based on their individual levels of development.</p>
<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>	World Systems Theory and Dependency Theory are based on LDCs being taken advantage of by MDCs and does not imply any upward mobility, whereas the Modernization model says that all countries are making their way to greater development.<br>
	Modernization Theory is applicable to progress and development in more stable regions, while Dependency Theory describes the effects modernization in one country has globally.<br>
	In modernization theory, all of the progress a region or state makes comes from a collective internal effort. Dependency theory picks up the pieces and connects the dots where modernization theory leaves room for interpretation</p>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<p>Both theories admit the leadership of western countries and their currently dominant position in the modern world, while undeveloped countries are characterized by socio-economic and political backwardness.<br>
The two theories agree that the cooperation between western countries and developing countries is constantly growing and leads to their integration.</p>
